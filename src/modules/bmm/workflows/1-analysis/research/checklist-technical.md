# Technical/Architecture Research Validation Checklist

## üö® CRITICAL: Source Verification and Fact-Checking (PRIORITY)

### Version Number Verification (MANDATORY)

- [ ] **EVERY** technology version number has cited source with URL
- [ ] Version numbers verified via WebSearch from {{current_year}} (NOT from training data!)
- [ ] Official documentation/release pages cited for each version
- [ ] Release dates included with version numbers
- [ ] LTS status verified from official sources (with URL)
- [ ] No "assumed" or "remembered" version numbers - ALL must be verified

### Technical Claim Source Verification

- [ ] **EVERY** feature claim has source (official docs, release notes, website)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks cite source (official benchmarks, third-party tests with URLs)
- [ ] Compatibility claims verified (official compatibility matrix, documentation)
- [ ] Community size/popularity backed by sources (GitHub stars, npm downloads, official stats)
- [ ] "Supports X" claims verified via official documentation with URL
- [ ] No invented capabilities or features

### Source Quality for Technical Data

- [ ] Official documentation prioritized (docs.technology.com > blog posts)
- [ ] Version info from official release pages (highest credibility)
- [ ] Benchmarks from official sources or reputable third-parties (not random blogs)
- [ ] Community data from verified sources (GitHub, npm, official registries)
- [ ] Pricing from official pricing pages (with URL and date verified)

### Multi-Source Verification (Critical Technical Claims)

- [ ] Major technical claims (performance, scalability) verified by 2+ sources
- [ ] Technology comparisons cite multiple independent sources
- [ ] "Best for X" claims backed by comparative analysis with sources
- [ ] Production experience claims cite real case studies or articles with URLs
- [ ] No single-source critical decisions without flagging need for verification

### Anti-Hallucination for Technical Data

- [ ] No invented version numbers or release dates
- [ ] No assumed feature availability without verification
- [ ] If current data not found, explicitly states "Could not verify {{current_year}} information"
- [ ] Speculation clearly labeled (e.g., "Based on trends, technology may...")
- [ ] No "probably supports" or "likely compatible" without verification

## Technology Evaluation

### Comprehensive Profiling

For each evaluated technology:

- [ ] Core capabilities and features are documented
- [ ] Architecture and design philosophy are explained
- [ ] Maturity level is assessed (experimental, stable, mature, legacy)

- [ ] Developer experience is considered
- [ ] Tooling ecosystem is reviewed
- [ ] Testing and debugging capabilities are examined

### Operational Assessment

- [ ] Deployment complexity is understood

## Comparative Analysis

### Multi-Dimensional Comparison

- [ ] Technologies are compared across relevant dimensions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are included (if available)
- [ ] Scalability characteristics are compared

## Decision Support

### Recommendations

- [ ] Primary recommendation is clearly stated with rationale
- [ ] Alternative options are explained with use cases
- [ ] Fit for user's specific context is explained
- [ ] Decision is justified by requirements and constraints

### Implementation Guidance

- [ ] Proof-of-concept approach is outlined
- [ ] Key implementation decisions are identified
- [ ] Migration path is described (if applicable)
- [ ] Success criteria are defined
- [ ] Validation approach is recommended

### Risk Management

- [ ] Technical risks are identified
- [ ] Mitigation strategies are provided
- [ ] Contingency options are outlined (if primary choice doesn't work)
- [ ] Exit strategy considerations are discussed

## Architecture Decision Record

### ADR Completeness

- [ ] Status is specified (Proposed, Accepted, Superseded)
- [ ] Context and problem statement are clear
- [ ] Decision drivers are documented
- [ ] All considered options are listed
- [ ] Chosen option and rationale are explained
- [ ] Consequences (positive, negative, neutral) are identified
- [ ] Implementation notes are included
- [ ] References to research sources are provided

## References and Source Documentation (CRITICAL)

### References Section Completeness

- [ ] Report includes comprehensive "References and Sources" section
- [ ] Sources organized by category (official docs, benchmarks, community, architecture)
- [ ] Every source includes: Title, Publisher/Site, Date Accessed, Full URL
- [ ] URLs are clickable and functional (documentation links, release pages, GitHub)
- [ ] Version verification sources clearly listed
- [ ] Inline citations throughout report reference the sources section

### Technology Source Documentation

- [ ] For each technology evaluated, sources documented:
  - Official documentation URL
  - Release notes/changelog URL for version
  - Pricing page URL (if applicable)
  - Community/GitHub URL
  - Benchmark source URLs
- [ ] Comparison data cites source for each claim
