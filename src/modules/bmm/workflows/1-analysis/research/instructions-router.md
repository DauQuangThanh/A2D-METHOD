# Research Workflow Router Instructions

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate in {communication_language}, generate documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>Web research is ENABLED - always use current {{current_year}} data</critical>

<critical>üö® ANTI-HALLUCINATION PROTOCOL - MANDATORY üö®</critical>
<critical>NEVER present information without a verified source - if you cannot find a source, say "I could not find reliable data on this"</critical>
<critical>ALWAYS cite sources with URLs when presenting data, statistics, or factual claims</critical>
<critical>REQUIRE at least 2 independent sources for critical claims (market size, growth rates, competitive data)</critical>
<critical>When sources conflict, PRESENT BOTH views and note the discrepancy - do NOT pick one arbitrarily</critical>
<critical>Flag any data you are uncertain about with confidence levels: [High Confidence], [Medium Confidence], [Low Confidence - verify]</critical>
<critical>Distinguish clearly between: FACTS (from sources), ANALYSIS (your interpretation), and SPECULATION (educated guesses)</critical>
<critical>When using WebSearch results, ALWAYS extract and include the source URL for every claim</critical>

<step n="2" goal="Discover research needs through conversation">

<action>Welcome {user_name} warmly. Position yourself as their research partner who uses live {{current_year}} web data. Ask what they're looking to understand or research.</action>

<action>Listen and collaboratively identify the research type based on what they describe:

- Market/Business questions ‚Üí Market Research
- Competitor questions ‚Üí Competitive Intelligence
- Customer questions ‚Üí User Research
- Technology questions ‚Üí Technical Research
- Industry questions ‚Üí Domain Research
- Creating research prompts for AI platforms ‚Üí Deep Research Prompt Generator

Confirm your understanding of what type would be most helpful and what it will produce.
